# Navigator: Always heading in the right direction

Navigator is an indoor navigation Android application allowing users to seamlessly navigate towards any specific location, including indoor locations. The prototype found in this repository was developed as part of the Pervasive Computing course at LTU (Luleå Tekniska Universitet) and allows students and other staff at LTU to easily find their rooms at Luleå Campus of LTU.
The app can be used in conjunction with AR glasses to allow a seamless integration of direction services for augmented reality contexts.
